    <h2>Professional Self-Assessment</h2>
    <p>
      Welcome to my professional portfolio. This site showcases my growth throughout the Bachelor of Science
      in Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University. You will find enhanced artifacts
      demonstrating my expertise in software engineering, algorithms and data structures, and database design.
      Each artifact is accompanied by a narrative explaining the improvements I made and the skills I demonstrated.

      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>
        I entered the computer science program with limited experience in software development and have since
        progressed to designing scalable systems, optimizing algorithms, and securing data storage. Through
        collaboration, communication, and continuous learning, I developed a robust engineering skillset that
        spans the full stack—from front-end interfaces to back-end services and databases.
      </p>
      <p>
        Key highlights of my journey include embracing agile methodologies for collaborative coding, sharpening
        my ability to communicate technical concepts to diverse audiences, applying algorithmic principles to
        solve real-world problems, leveraging innovative tools and frameworks, and adopting a security mindset
        to protect data and systems.
      </p>
      <p>
        The artifacts linked above illustrate this growth across three critical areas of computer science.
        Together they provide evidence of my readiness to contribute to industry projects as a back-end or
        data engineer.
