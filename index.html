    <h2>Professional Self-Assessment</h2>

    <p>
      Welcome to my professional portfolio. This site showcases my growth
      throughout the Bachelor of Science in Computer Science program at
      Southern New Hampshire University.

      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>
        I entered the computer science program with limited experience in software
        development and have since progressed to designing scalable systems,
        optimizing algorithms, and securing data storage.
      </p>

      <p>
        Through collaboration, communication, and continuous learning, I developed
        a robust engineering skill set spanning back-end services, algorithms,
        and databases.
      </p>

      <p>
        The artifacts linked throughout this portfolio demonstrate my readiness
        to contribute as a software, backend, or data-focused engineer.
