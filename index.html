    <h2>Professional Self‑Assessment</h2>
    <p>Welcome to my professional portfolio. This site showcases my growth throughout the Bachelor of Science in Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University. You will find enhanced artifacts demonstrating my expertise in software engineering, algorithms and data structures, and database design. Each artifact is accompanied by a narrative explaining the improvements I made and the skills I demonstrated.</p>
    <p>The self‑assessment below summarises my strengths, experiences, and professional goals. For a full detailed report, please refer to the <a href="downloads/professional_self_assessment.docx">professional self‑assessment document</a>.</p>

      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>I entered the computer science program with limited experience in software development and have since progressed to designing scalable systems, optimising algorithms, and securing data storage. Through collaboration, communication, and continuous learning, I developed a robust engineering skillset that spans the full stack—from front‑end interfaces to back‑end services and databases.</p>
      <p>Key highlights of my journey include embracing agile methodologies for collaborative coding, sharpening my ability to communicate technical concepts to diverse audiences, applying algorithmic principles to solve real‑world problems, leveraging innovative tools and frameworks, and adopting a security mindset to protect data and systems.</p>
      <p>The artifacts linked above illustrate this growth across three critical areas of computer science. Together they provide evidence of my readiness to contribute to industry projects as a back‑end or data engineer.</p>
